## **Human-Centric Design**

Oxyform has been made keeping in mind a patient with mild to moderate continuous oxygen needs in a hospital setting. A hospital setting presents us with less stringent constraints than a home setting as there would be trained operators, and redundancy is expected with backup machines.

## **First Principles thinking**

The first step to employing the first principles is to understand why the current oxygen concentrators are designed the way they are. This leads us to the central need for the PSA technique to control the timing of adsorption & de-adsorption cycles for a given zeolite. Current popular designs use many solenoid valves with electric control of their timings.

Armed with an understanding of the current design and setting out to build an alternate solution from scratch, we explored to see how we could simplify the valves and their timing mechanism. This led us to employ the rotary valve design, which reduces the number of solenoid valves from eight to one and eliminates the need for electronic control of timing.

## **Replicability**

Since the design would be open-sourced and many different makers are expected to build their products based on this, ease of replicability was a significant consideration in the design process.

## **Locally Sourced**

Aiming for maximum adoption across the country, sourcing could become a bottleneck. We focused on choosing components that would be widely and locally available so the makers, even from rural areas, can build based on this design.

## **Built to last**

Environment and usage patterns necessitate that the chosen components and the assembly are built to last for at least 4-5 years.
