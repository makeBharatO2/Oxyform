# Oxyform
This is the source repository for design & build docs for the indegenous open source concentrator by Bharat O2 team. For more information on this initiative, pls visit [Bharath O2 website.](https://www.notion.so/Bharat-02-Oxyform-c85b40149b044214aaf8b3298170dbe9)

**Salient features:**

 - A scalable and open-source oxygen concentrator design - **delivering 93% oxygen at 5 liters per minute**. It can be scaled to up to 10LPM, costing *approx INR 11000*, and is built with **locally** available parts. 
 - **CAM Valve Innovation** *almost halves the number of parts* (and so the failure points) compared to commonly discussed designs.
 - It **eliminates** the need for electronic control circuits.
 
 **Why**
 
 - The current oxygen crisis in India has caused an exponential increase in oxygen demand. The majority of demand is for smaller flow rates of 5L/min which can be met with Oxygen concentrators. 
 -  There is not enough supply of oxygen concentrators and the available ones are expensive enough not to be in reach of many Indians.
 - The demand is expected to persist beyond the current covid wave as the nation equips itself to prepare for any future waves and spread to rural areas.

**What**

Produce a design that enables makers & manufacturers in far corners of India to build a prototype
 - as fast as possible
 - as cheaply as possible
 - with as many locally available parts
 - Fork, iterate and publish your own designs.

**How**

 - Understand the [design here](https://www.notion.so/Genesis-Build-f406cf4217994b059c0a0edbeb139fb5) or follow the documentation.
 - Pay attention to the rotary **[CAM Valve](https://youtu.be/7uSr5xrOVtQ)**, which is the key innovation here.
 - Source the parts - [BOM](https://www.notion.so/ff45cc9090554a279fbb2f66bb04dd5d?v=d6aa3f73a6bf47c7845783425e2e9eb4)
 - Build the prototype, iterate & publish your own designs.
